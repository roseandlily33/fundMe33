# Fund Me
Mini #14 Crowdfunding App 

## Description: 
Handlebars full stack application built with a small amount of starter code I tried to do as much as possible 
on my own, and then filled in a couple of blanks, and built out the front end from there.

## Screenshots:

## What I learned:
In this mini project I learned how to use handlebars, which I enjoyed so much and how the front end works with the backend.
